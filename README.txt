USAGE

To connect your MOTION devices to Homey, you must have a WIFI bridge in your home network that can control up to 30 different blinds. The bridge is configured with the blinds you need by using the official MOTION Blinds app. Homey communicates with one or more of these bridges to control the devices connected to them. You can also link the blinds to a remote. Note that remotes are a useful addition to MOTION devices but cannot be added directly to the bridge or Homey. The remote controls the blind directly, and the blind reports what is happening back to the bridge and Homey. 

In order for Homey to be allowed to send commands to the bridge, it needs a key. The key can be configured in the Homey MOTION app settings. You will find instructions there on how to obtain the key.

EVE MOTIONBLINDS

The new Eve MotionBlinds product line is also supported by this app, provided you connect them using the WIFI bridge as there is currently no support for Matter in Homey.

AVAILABILITY

Motion products are developed by Coulisse and can be found in window coverings from various other manufacturers across the world.
